                    Hey there, my name is Raphael! I'm a young and passionate self-taught programmer. My dream career is, you guessed it, to be a programmer! Some things are a bit more fun to code than others, but as long as I code, I never get bored of solving problems ^^! I'm also a huge fan of maths and love to learn. I love improving as well, so if you'd like to criticize my code constructively, then you're more than welcomed!

        <!-- More about -->
        <section class="more-about">
            <h2>...Even <i><b>MORE</b></i> about me!</h2>
            <p>
                I started coding a bit ago in 2018. At the time, I was only thirteen. My city did not offer any middle school programming class and so I had to improvise when I wanted to learn. I started small with Python and after a few days, I was already making Blender 3D Scripts. It was nothing too complex, but it was good enough for a few 3D artists to look forward to my next scripts! Fast forward a few months later and I'm programming Source Engine Mods with C++ and jumping from project to project.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Internet is a wonderful place filled with often untapped knowledge. Although coding is not for everybody, I truly believe that it is one of the best skills to have in our time and it is something everybody can learn once they've found the right resources online like I have. Everything I've learned comes from free resources from many websites across the web and it's all thanks to this wonderful community that allows growth and encourages learning through mistakes and experiences! 
            </p>
            <p>
                Going into adulthood, I have participated in many projects in small and big teams. I even lead some of them! Although I have some favourite languages, I've played around most popular programming languages and I've learned problem solving over simple code memorization. That means that no matter what programming language I'll be using, I can always find the solution to the problem presented in front of me. There might be a small learning curve for languages I have not yet encountered, but with the way I developped my skillset, this curve will be the easiest it could ever be to overcome!
